\section{Ethical Agreement}
\label{sec:ethical}
First of all we want to make clear that what we are going to present is only done for educational purposes and anyone reading this is implicitly agreeing on the following ethical agreement.
\newline
The tools and the techniques presented in this report and in the relative laboratory lecture may only be used within this context, against systems or environments either you own or for which you received the explicit provable authorization from the legitimate owner and only for the purposes the owner authorized you.
\newline
Any use of any of the techniques, tools and attacks presented outside of any scenario that does not fall, partially or entirely, into one of the previously described may be persecuted as conforming to the current legislation.
\newline
The infrastructure provided, in form of Virtual Machines, is deliberately isolated from the rest of the network with no bridges to connect to the outside world and are intended to be deliberately vulnerable. You are allowed to make any modification you wish to the configuration in for testing purposes; any modification you may do is at your own risk and we take no responsibility for any mistake or damage you could potentially make, accidentally or on purpose, to either your own system or to other people' systems.
